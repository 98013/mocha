    Closure Concepts....
    <div>

        <div>the closure is the lexical environment that includes the inner function and the variables from the outer
            function that
            the inner function can access
        </div>
        <div>
            So, while you could say the inner function is a closure, it's more accurate to say that the closure is the
            combination
            of the inner function and the variables it has access to from the outer function.
